# Bio-Inspired-Discrete-Optimization
Project for IT-3708 - Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence

It implements two approaches (ant colony and particle swarm) to solve a discrete optimization problem of job ordering in Rust.

The inputs are described in [here](/particle_swarm/test_data/Description of Input Files.pdf)

The code was designed purely for submission so it is very light on comments.
